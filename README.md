# DevCamper Frontend App

![Project start page](/DevCamper.png)

> DevCamper App - React frontend created to be used with the DevCamper API that was written while taking Udemy course 'Node.js API Masterclass With Express & MongoDB' by Brad Traversy.

## Description

After taking the Node.js course I decided to write a frontend for the API. This application is the result of that. It was written using React and generated with create-react-app.

I tried to utilize most of the functionality that the backend API provided. I used Brad's static html pages as a guide for the creation of the app. The backend has been deployed to Heroku and the frontend to Netlify.
